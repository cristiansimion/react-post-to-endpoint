## Usage
```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
This will start your react app that will allow you to upload the file to the endpoint set in the code. This repo is made to be used with the `upload-local` endpoint from the other [repository here](https://github.com/cristiansimion/micro-object-storage)

Makes use of the same `upload` field and can be swapped on the repository above to upload directly to the `DigitalOcean Object Storage`.
